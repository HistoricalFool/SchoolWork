  \section*{Question 4.2}
    \subsection*{Problem}
      \subsubsection*{(a)}
        Show that, under random sampling and the zero conditional mean assumption $\EE(u|\textbf{x})=0$, $\EE(\textbf{\hat\beta}|\textbf{X})=\beta$ if $\textbf{XX'}$ is nonsingular. (Hint: use property CE.5 in the appendix of chapter 2)
      \subsubsection*{(b)}
        In addition to the assumption from part a, assume that $\var(u|\textbf{x}) = \sigma^2$. Show that $\var(\hat{\beta}|\textbf{X}) = \sigma^2(\textbf{(XX')}^{-1})$
  \subsection*{Solutions}
\section*{Question 4.3}
  \subsection*{Problem}
    Suppose that in the linear model 4.5, $\EE(\textbf{x'}u)=\textbf{0}$ (where $\textbf{x}$ contains unity), $\var(u|\textbf{x})=\sigma^2$, but $\EE(u|\textbf{x})\ne\EE(u)$. 
    \subsubsection*{(a)}
      Is it true that $\EE(u^2|\textbf{x}) = \sigma^2$?
    \subsubsection*{(b)}
      What relevance does part a have for OLS estimation?
  \subsection*{Solutions}
\section*{Question 4.17}
  \subsection*{Problem}
     
\section*{Question 5.1}
  \subsection*{Problem}
    In this problem you are to establish the algebraic equivalence between 2SLS
    and OLS estimation of an equation containing an additional regressor. Although the
    result is completely general, for simplicity consider a model with a single (suspected) endogenous variable:
    \begin{gather*}
      y_1 = \textbf{z_1\delta_1} + \alpha_1y_2 + u_1\\
      y_2 = \textbf{z\pi}_2 + v_2 
    \end{gather*}
    For notational clarity, we use y2 as the suspected endogenous variable and z as the
    vector of all exogenous variables. The second equation is the reduced form for y2.
    Assume that z has at least one more element than z1. \\
    \\
    We know that one estimator of $(\delta_1,\alpha_1)$ is the 2SLS estimator using instruments $\textbf{x}$. Consider an alternative estimator of ðd1; a1Þ: (a) estimate the reduced form by OLS, and save the residuals $\hat{v}_2$; (b) estimate the following equation by OLS:
    \begin{gather*}
      y_1 = \textbf{z_1\delta_1} + \alpha_1y_2 + \rho_1\textbf{\hat{v}}_2 + error
    \end{gather*}
    Show that the OLS estimates of $\textbf{\delta_1}$ and $\alpha_1$ from this regression are identical to the 2SLS estimators.
