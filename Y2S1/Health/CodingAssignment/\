# Fixed Effects Model

1. Start by coming up with a research question where you might use this research design.
This does not need to be too creative, I just want an example. However, I would prefer
if it wasn’t the one I used in class and was vaguely related to health. Intuitively and
in words, describe what the endogeneity concern might be with a question like this.
2. Tell me basics about the dataset you simulate. What is your unit of observation? Then,
in words, describe what variables you are assuming constitute the “true model” and
which variables you are assuming you can observe and cannot observe. Describe any
important correlations between variables. Also, describe other variables, like policies
(for diff-in-diff), thresholds (for RD), or instruments (for IV). Give me an equation for
your “true model” and introduce all the letters you are using. I want an equation, written like they would be written in a paper, not STATA code. Then separately, tell
me what your “true” coefficients are (i.e. β = 2).
3. In words and equations, describe the regressions you are running. Both the regressions
that have an endogeneity problem and the ones which you “fix.”
4. Produce a table of summary statistics with the mean, standard deviation, number
of observations, min and max of each variable you use. This is both regressors and
outcome variables. You do not need to show me summary statistics for fixed effects.
5. Produce regression results in nice table layout, with intuitive variable labels (i.e. not
stata variable names), and not too many variables (i.e. don’t display fixed effects).
Describe the regression results for each of your regressions in words.
