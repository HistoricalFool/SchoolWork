# Broad Question:
Broadly speaking, this paper seeks to understand how price increases of drugs resulting from R&D corresponds to consumer welfare. Basically, does consumer welfare increase despite the price increases, or does the innovation in the drug not necessitate the price increase?

# Specific Question:
Specifically, the authors primarily look into rheumatoid arthritic and hepatitis c drugs, and seek to ascertain how the innovations in these drugs have impacted consumer welfare. They examine other disease therapies, but the primary study focuses on the two mentioned. They create models of consumer welfare via quality adjusted life years and value of statistical life years, and are able to uncover the relationship between drug innovation and consumer welfare.

# Policy Maker's Interest:
A policy maker would have many reasons to be interested in a project like this. Firstly, they would have tangible evidence of pricing effects given quality, thus influencing any sort of price floor or ceiling policy. Then, there is the idea of federal research funding for pharmaceuticals. This sort of study and model would allow for a quantifiable measure of when a drug/therapy is worth investing in as the government versus which may be less able to markedly improve consumer welfare.

# Economist's Interest:
An economist would be interested for the novel addition of innovation to consumer welfare and pricing index models, as well as the clever data sources used. Further, an economist should always be interested in consumer welfare in an industry such as health, allowing for extension into willingness to pay and other sorts of demand estimation.

# What We Learn About Economics:
We learn a lot from this paper. Firstly, we find that hepatitis C innovation has increased consumer welfare via QALY despite massive cost increases. Secondly, we find that rheumatoid arthritis therapies saw prices rise faster than quality was able to. Lastly, we find interesting methods of modeling how consumer welfare responds to innovation, which could be extended to many different industries.
