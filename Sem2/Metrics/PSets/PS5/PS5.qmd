# Question 1

## Part A

Let's first make our sample
```{r}
rm(list = ls())

library(dplyr)
library(haven)
library(numDeriv)

data <- read_dta('~/SchoolWork/Sem2/Metrics/PSets/PS5/cps09mar.dta')
male_dat <- data %>%
  filter(female == 0) %>%
  mutate(Y = ifelse(union == 1, 1, 0)) %>%
  mutate(black = ifelse(race == 2, 1, 0))
```
