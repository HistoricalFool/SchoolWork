# Akhil Meeting Notes
## How to not fuck up a second time!

- 1a good
- 1b not a second price --> firm b gets a better payoff i.e. bid under b by $1

- 2a VCG is maxing total value
  - No need for expectation
- 2b Take sum of transfers and then expand --> formula for t() from notes and sum over all i to see it works out

- 3a correct
- 3b correct but need to be more specific
- 3c values overlap but lie on an interval in MS thm
- 3d go thru on own and don't overcomplicate, dont prove. Write IC and IR and then inequality is violated for types above $\frac{3}{4}$

- Next prelim also 3 questions from Akhil with similar format Q1 shortest, Q2 longer, Q3 longest
