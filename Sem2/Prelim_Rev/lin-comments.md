## How not to fuck up this time

- what he wants to test:
  - probability in distribution:
    - stadard uniform is 0,1 with density of 1
    - density in that question was $\frac{1}{2}$
      - looking at parametric distribution file in notes
      - density should be $\frac{1}{b-a}$
    - wants to test similar concept so very similar concept in second exam
  - second part of q1: look back at hw two are independent so cannot be separated
  - third part of q1: based on independence, conditional density = unconditional density --> look in lecture notes for that
  - second trial will be super similar
- second question:
  - a and b:
  - $f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\phi\sigma^2}}\cdot \exp{-(\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2})}$ --> take log of f(x) tkae FOC for part b end up with $\hat{\mu} = \bar{x}$
  - part c: plug in $\hat{\mu}$ for $\mu$
  - part d: take FOC with respect to $\sigma^2$ specifically, not $\sigma$. $=-\frac{n}{2}\frac{1}{\sigma^2} + \sum(x_i - \bar{x})^2/2(\sigma^2)^2$ --> $\hat{\sigma}^2 = \frac{\sum(x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n}$
- third question:
  - part a: rewrite more clearly
  - part b: use z-test
    - variance is known, so use z-test
  - part c: $t = \frac{\hat{\mu}}{\sqrt{\frac{\sigma^2}{n}}}$ but since $\sigma^2$ is known, use z-test
  - part d: know the difference in consumption when prices increase, so in this case testing on one sided. 
- prepare on material from before midterm --> similar things
- may swap to a method of moment question instead of MLE.
